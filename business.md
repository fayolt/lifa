## **OUR** BUSINESSES
{: center}

In order to guarantee the energy that mobilizes the world, we operate from start to finish in the sugarcane chain, from the cultivation of sugarcane to the production of sugar, ethanol, and bio-energy to the logistics, distribution, and trading of fuels through the Shell brand.

Our operations also include Shell Select convenience stores and the Shell Box app, which gives consumers a differentiated experience at Shell service stations

We're in the sugar for coffee every morning. We're in the hygiene and beauty products that use ethanol as an ingredient. We're in the fuel for cars and planes that shorten distance. We're in the electricity generated from sugarcane straw. Everything to make life and the economy go around. Get to know each area of our work
