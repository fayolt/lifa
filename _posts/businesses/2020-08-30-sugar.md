{:center}

By 2024, we will become one of the largest individual sugar producers in West Africa, bringing energy to people around the world. We will reach a leading position in the sugar production sector by investing in research, technology, and the creation of solutions in the segment, as well as establishing partnerships with customers. 


We will produce thousands of tons of sugars per year, and will include practically all of the varieties on the market in our portfolio. From liquid sugars, refined and crystalline, to organic and VHP (Very High Polarization), the most exported type of sugar, which, as a raw product, can e used as raw material for refining and various other processes.
