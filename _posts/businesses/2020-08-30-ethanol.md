## ETHANOL
{:center}

The energy of the future is one of our roots. Investing in clean and renewable energy, we have become the largest sugar cane ethanol producer in Brazil, trading to different markets, from small to big business. 

We annually produce billions of liters and inaugurated a second-generation ethanol production plant, obtained from sugarcane biomass, on a commercial scale in Brazil, another solution to meet the growing demand for biofuels, always betting on innovation and growth.
