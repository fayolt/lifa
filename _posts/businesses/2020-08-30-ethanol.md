## ETHANOL
{:center}

The energy of the future is one of our roots. Investing in clean and renewable energy, we are an important sugar cane ethanol producer in Benin, trading to different markets, from small to big business. 


Our annual production is projected to be one of the largest in Africa and the plant will be inaugurated mid-2023. We will implement a second-generation ethanol production plant, obtained from sugarcane biomass, on a commercial scale in Benin, another solution to meet the growing demand for biofuels, always betting on innovation and growth.
