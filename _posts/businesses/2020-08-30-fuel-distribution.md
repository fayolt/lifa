## FUEL DISTRIBUTION
{:center}

We distribute and market fuels at service stations, airports, and for customers in the B2B market through the Shell brand. We sell about 33 billion liters (8.7 billion gallons) a year to more than 3,300 customers in the B2B segment and over 7,300 Shell branded sites.

With optimized processes and use of CIF Logistics, we guarantee quality and product integrity along the way, such as punctuality and end-to-end traceability up to the time of delivery.

We operate in every region of the country in 69 airport refueling sites and 70 fuel distribution terminals.
