## ENERGY
{:center}

We generate electricity for our own consumption and trading for distribution networks. We operate in a circular economy system, taking advantage of all the waste and inputs used in our generation processes for new forms of energy, contributing directly to the environment, generating less industrial waste and creating sustainable products that help to clean-up the Brazilian energy matrix.

To boost our industry's future with new ideas and solutions, we have a portfolio of green energy from renewable sources such as biomass, sugarcane straw, biogas, and the sun.
