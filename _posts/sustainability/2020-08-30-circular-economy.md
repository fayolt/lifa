## **CIRCULAR** ECONOMY
{:center}

Circular economics is the recovery, reuse, and recycling of materials and energy. We have adopted this system in our production chain, from sugarcane planting to its by-products in the production of biogas, 2nd-generation ethanol, electricity, and possibly fertilizers (in the near future), returning to the earth and collaborating for a new harvest, closing the cycle. We believe that better use of natural and financial resources ensures greater efficiency in our processes. It is our business model and we believe we can bring together more people and businesses with fewer natural resources.
