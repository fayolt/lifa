# **CHAIN** RESPONSIBILITY
{:center}

We have an extensive chain, from the planting of sugarcane to fuel distribution, and therefore, we promote an integrated chain with optimized processes. We nurture the sustainability of the sugarcane supply chain, especially strategically, regardless of the origin of the raw material. Therefore, we have sustainability programs that already cover more than 95% of the sugarcane that supplies our entire operation. We work in strategic partnerships with small holders farmers, and work together towards best practices, building a broad-based sustainable awareness, assisting and providing ongoing support to women in agriculture.
