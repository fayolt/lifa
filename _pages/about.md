We are among the largest private business groups in Africa and our team is our biggest differential: around 29,000 employees and 15,000 business partners throughout the continent.

Originating in Brazil, we also work in Argentina and we have the ambition to win the world. We propel the people and the country with energy solutions. Energy is our business, and is in our name.

 We integrate all the stages of the production chain: from the cultivation of sugarcane to the production and sale of sugar and ethanol, the generation of bio-energy, and fuel distribution through Shell's brand license..
